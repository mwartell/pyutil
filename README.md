A toy library that I use as a means to explore ASTs, typing,
and now CI. The implementation is really overwrought for the
task.

# wordlist
Generates lists of words from a variety of sources for test purposes.

## sources
 - google-1000-english.txt https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english

# xkcd_pass
Yet another implementation of "correct horse battery staple" from xkcd using
the WordList class.
